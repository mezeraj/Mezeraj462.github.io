## HW1: Reflections on FOSS

## HW4: This Bugs Me
Exercise 6.4 - Find the Oldest Bug:
[The Oldest Bug](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/issues/489) is a bug that says that the dynamic theme feature for darkreader does not work on youtube. The issue is marked as not resolved. I don't actaully know what the dynamic theme feature is so it may have been removed because right now users need to manually change the theme of websites so the feature may have been removed hence why it hasn't been fixed. 
Exercise 6.5 - Create Your Bug Tracker Account:
Our chosen FOSS uses github issues to track its bugs and there is no need to install other software. 
Exercise 6.6.1 - Reproduce a Bug:
I tried to reproduce a bug that caused google sheets to load forever with darkreader enabled and I could not. The user posted a link and reported that with darkreader enabled that it would load forever. There was one other response saying that they also could not reproduce the bug. 
Exercise 6.7.1 - Bug Triage:
I had difficulty finding bugs that weren't boing looked at. Everything already either had a fix pushed to it, had extensive comments and questions, or the poster suddenly stopped responding. The only bugs that seemed like they might need assistance were bugs on MacOS and I don't have access to a mac.
